                            <p>Food waste is one of the biggest, most solvable ecological issues we are currently facing. Roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year — approximately 1.3 billion tonnes — gets lost or wasted. Food losses and waste amounts to roughly US$ 680 billion in industrialized countries and US$ 310 billion in developing countries.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Urban food shoppers need a way to organize their shopping lists because they are wasting time and money while producing food waste. Food waste is a growing concern for a lot of people, it has a negative impact from a financial, environmental, and emotional standpoint.</p>

                        <h4>GOAL:</h4>
                        <div class="opacity-box">
                            <p>The goal of this project was to design an app that will help cut back on food waste by helping the user organize their pantries and shop smarter. I believe that by developing an app that integrates shopping lists with pantry supplies, for urban grocery shoppers, they  will achieve a significant decrease in food waste.</p>

                            <p>For this project, I followed the 5 Planes of UX methodology.  I determined this was the best course of action to help me focus on my goal as well as align my activities to address the user experience consistently.</p>

                            <p>After conducting user interviews, I determined that a lack of organization was the most prominent contributor to food waste. The participants were in the habit of picking up groceries on their way home from work without using a list. This meant they often picked up items they already had on hand, as well as forgetting essential ingredients for the dish they wanted to make.</p>

                            <p>The Minimal Viable Product for Food Queue is an interactive grocery and pantry lists that the user can edit. Aligning with my persona and goals, I determined the features to be included needed to be:</p>
                            <p><ol>
  <li>Shopping List:: this is an essential feature for the user to stay organized and know what they need to purchase. The list will be editable and searchable, which will be useful for the user to have Food Queue adapt to their needs.</li>
  <li>Recipe Integration:: having a space to store recipes as well as create shopping lists from them will be valuable in assisting the user in their organizational needs.</li>
  <li>Fresh Tips:: this feature will help the user ensure freshness of their food, which will help cut back on food waste. Ideally, there would be integrated directly in the shopping lists, which will make it easier for the user to store the food properly as soon as possible.</li>
                    </ol>

                            <p>User Testing</p>
                            <p>One of the initial observations was that the Users where going directly to search when prompted with a task. As it was, the interface wasn't intuitive, there were too many options and routes to take. An example, I asked the User to Remove Onions. They tapped on Onions right away, to interact w it. Although one User saw and understood the intention of the Help key, he did not think to select it when trying to complete an unknown task. Even with prompting, the User still wouldn't touch the question mark within the screen they were having issues w, but did head to Home to get instructions.</p><br>
                            <p>I had expected Search to be  a major component in the design, but hadn't considered that it would be the first step the User took to perform a task. I would like to dive deeper into search function usability, it was one of the Key Components for the App. The research is baking up the hypothesis that Search was a key feature for my User Group.</p>
                            <p><i><b>This is where I jumped back in</b></i></p>
                            <p> My biases had gotten in the way and I wanted to design something with  a lot features, rather then work within the confines of the Least Resistance principle. I had focused on ways to help people stay organized, how to stay ahead of the food waste game. Rather than trying to change someone’s behavior, I wanted to approach working with it. I worked with the pattern that developed in the pain points the interviewees spoke about. All of them organized on the go, and even with all the organizational tools they were already utilizing, there was still a lot of food waste. Given that the app is intended to alleviate stress, I focused in on what to do with the food before it became waste. From there, the app pivoted into a trading platform for food items and leftover meals.</p>

                            <p>Create  a more robust scheduling system: connect the Floral Feed and the Image Upload features into the scheduling flow. This will allow the User to move w/more ease as well as lessen the amount of steps needed to set up a schedule. <br>

Integrate a Helpful Hints resource: GroJoe’rs can search for tips and tricks for their specific plants, ideally there will be community moderators to to communicate directly with. This will ensure the User can get access to as much information as possible w/out leaving the app. <br>

More extensive testing of scheduling: this project had a short time line, which left little time for a deeper dive into the scheduling system. User testing to determine how much more extensive the Scheduling is useful, ie having a Text to Phone feature, if photo integration would be useful.
