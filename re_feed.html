                            <p>Food waste is one of the biggest, most solvable ecological issues we are currently facing. Roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year — approximately 1.3 billion tonnes — gets lost or wasted. Food losses and waste amounts to roughly US $680 billion in industrialized countries and US $310 billion in developing countries.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Food waste is a growing concern for a lot of people, it has a negative impact from a financial, environmental, and emotional standpoint.</p>

                            <p>The objective of this project is to help reduce the amount of food waste produced by individuals in an urban setting.</p>

                        <div class="opacity-box">
                            <p>For this project, I decided to follow the 5 Planes of UX methodology. I determined this was the best course of action to help me focus on my goal as well as align my activities to address the user experience consistently.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I first approached this project in 2017 during my first UX course. I had 6 weeks to go through the entire design process.  I initially focused on ways to help people stay organized, how to stay ahead of the food waste game, and created <a href="food_queue.html" target="_blank" class="hcolour">FoodQueue</a>. Recently, I was given a design challenge regarding food waste and I thought it would be a great opportunity to dive back into this project to complete the UI process. It was a perfect occasion to measure my growth as a designer, and I was looking forward to diving deeper into the design of the app.</p>

                        <div class="opacity-box">
                            <p>I conducted User Interviews with 3 participants. Each interview was roughly 40 minutes. I determined at the time that a lack of organization was the most prominent contributor to food waste. The participants were in the habit of picking up groceries on their way home from work without using a list. This meant they often picked up items they already had on hand, as well as forgetting essential ingredients for the dish they wanted to make.</p>

                            <p>The Minimal Viable Product for Food Queue is an interactive grocery and pantry lists that the user can edit. Aligning with my persona and goals, I determined the features to be included needed to be:</p>
                            <p><ol>
  <li>Shopping List:: this is an essential feature for the user to stay organized and know what they need to purchase. The list will be editable and searchable, which will be useful for the user to have Food Queue adapt to their needs.</li>
  <li>Recipe Integration:: having a space to store recipes as well as create shopping lists from them will be valuable in assisting the user in their organizational needs.</li>
  <li>Fresh Tips:: this feature will help the user ensure freshness of their food, which will help cut back on food waste. Ideally, there would be integrated directly in the shopping lists, which will make it easier for the user to store the food properly as soon as possible.</li>
                    </ol>

                            <p>User Testing</p>
                            <p>After creating a clickable prototype, I did user testing with 2 participants. I asked them both to perform 3 basic tasks. One of the initial observations was that the Users where going directly to search when prompted with a task. As it was, the interface wasn't intuitive, there were too many options and routes to take. I realized I had been overzealous on my first attempt and the app became very confusing to use. As I had reached my timeline, I set the project aside until I could dedicate the focus to complete it.</p>

                            <p>Time Constraints</p>
                            <p>As this was a design challenge, I had 72 hours to complete the project. When I revisited the data, I observed another pattern emerging in the pain points the interviewees spoke about. All of them organized on the go, and even with all the organizational tools they were already utilizing, there was still a lot of food waste. Given that the app is intended to alleviate stress, I focused in on what to do with the food before it became waste. From there, the app pivoted into a trading platform for food items and leftover meals.</p>
                            <br> <p>All the people I interviewed previously envisioned themselves using the app at the grocery store or on the go. While the intention of the experience has changed, I realized many of the target audience will be using this app on the go. </p>

                            <p>Content Strategy</p>
                            <p>In order to simplify the experience, I went with a three icon menu bar at the bottom of the screen. This is meant to be accessed with one hand, using the thumb as the main digit, keeping the other hand free for your basket or cart. This also reduces cognitive-load, giving the user a very quick path into the different feeds. And allows for an easier on-boarding experience, an important aspect as many of the users are already dealing with anxieties about food waste. </p><br>
                            <p>Minimal Viable Product</p>
                            <p>I determined the key features needed to be:</p>
                            <p><ol>
  <li>Food Feed:: the listing of items up for trade.</li>
  <li>Message Centre:: the user will need a space to communicate with the other user.</li>
  <li>Upload:: a quick and easy way to upload food into the Food Feed</li>
                    </ol>
                        </div>

                            <p>For the aesthetic of the Food Feed, I followed the advice of Master Chefs; always give the food it’s respect. This is translated into the clean UI and light colours. The image of the food is meant to take centre stage and speak for itself, this also allows for the user to scroll quickly through the feed when looking for ingredients. As there was a time constraint, I started the palette and UI choices in conjunction with the wireframing.</p>

                            <p>After working out the architecture of the app, I created high-fidelity wireframes to be used in the hi-fi prototype. As was determined by the brief of the design challenge, I created 3 User Flows using inVision. I determined the most predominant flows would be:</p>
                         <p><ol>
  <li>Post an Item:: the key function of the app, it needed to be easy to accomplish with one hand.</li>
  <li>Make an Offer:: another key function, a simple means to make an offer on an item of interest</li>
  <li>Messaging a User::  giving the user access to the messages to set up meeting times and further bartering</li>
                    </ol>

                            <p>When designing the colour Pallete, I went w Purples/Lilacs as the colour signifies abundance and pleasantries. I really wanted this experience to lend itself to the feeling of abundance. The type is easy to glance at and has a calming effect.</p>
                            <p>Every item or meal listed has a Food Card, where the user can get the relevant details about the item and start an interaction to trade. Many of the items being traded are perishable, gaining the users' trust is essential to them having a positive experience. The soothing colour scheme and nostalgic recipe card design speak to this. The Freshness Scale is meant to soothe the mind of the user, as well as convey important information quickly.</p>

                            <p>Create  a more robust scheduling system: connect the Floral Feed and the Image Upload features into the scheduling flow. This will allow the User to move w/more ease as well as lessen the amount of steps needed to set up a schedule. <br>

Integrate a Helpful Hints resource: GroJoe’rs can search for tips and tricks for their specific plants, ideally there will be community moderators to to communicate directly with. This will ensure the User can get access to as much information as possible w/out leaving the app. <br>

More extensive testing of scheduling: this project had a short time line, which left little time for a deeper dive into the scheduling system. User testing to determine how much more extensive the Scheduling is useful, ie having a Text to Phone feature, if photo integration would be useful.
